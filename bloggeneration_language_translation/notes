Topic: Building a Multi-Language Blog Generation Graph
1. Context

You already have a blog generation graph (build_topic_graph) with:

Title Creation node

Content Generation node

Now you want to extend it so the blog can be generated in different languages based on an input (e.g., Hindi, French).

2. New Input

Instead of only providing topic, the request.json will now also have:

{
  "topic": "AI in Education",
  "language": "Hindi"
}


language tells the system which translation path to take.

3. New Method
Method Name
build_language_graph(self)

Purpose

Build a graph that:

Starts with topic

Generates title

Generates content

Routes output based on language choice

Translates to that language

Ends

Docstring Example

Builds a blog generation graph with topic and language inputs, generating and translating content accordingly.

4. Nodes in the Graph

Start

Title Creation (already implemented)

Content Generation (already implemented)

Root (decides which translation path to take — to be implemented)

Hindi Translation (to be implemented)

French Translation (to be implemented)

End

5. Edges (Flow)

Start → Title Creation

Title Creation → Content Generation

Content Generation → Root

Conditional Edge:

If language == "Hindi" → Hindi Translation

Else → French Translation

Hindi Translation → End

French Translation → End

6. Conditional Edges

Implemented with:

self.graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "root",
    condition=self.blog_node.route_decision,
    path_map={
        "Hindi": "hindi_translation",
        "French": "french_translation"
    }
)


route_decision() will check language input and return the correct path.

7. Remaining Work

Implement node functions for:

root (decides translation path)

hindi_translation (actually performs Hindi translation)

french_translation (performs French translation)

Modify main execution logic so that:

If use_case includes language, call build_language_graph() instead of build_topic_graph().

9. Key Takeaways

We’re adding language branching logic to the existing blog generation graph.

Conditional edges decide which translation path to follow.

The route_decision function is central — it maps language input to the correct node.

Only the graph structure is built right now — translation logic will be added later.
